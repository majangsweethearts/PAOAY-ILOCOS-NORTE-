            <h2>Brief History of Paoay</h2>
            <p>Paoay, a town in Ilocos Norte, lies along the coastal plain facing the China Sea, with Laoag to the north, Currimao to the south, Sarrat to the east, and the Luzon Sea to the west. Founded by the Augustinians in 1593, Paoay became part of Ilocos Norte when the province was officially divided in 1818. The town played a role in several revolts against Spanish rule, including the 1814 protest against Ferdinand VII's decree. During the Filipino-American War, Paoay faced significant destruction due to resistance against American forces.</p>
            <p>Paoay's economy thrives on agriculture, particularly garlic farming, and a vibrant weaving industry producing blankets, towels, and pillowcases. Its coastline is both a fishing ground and a tourist destination, with notable landmarks like the Malaca√±ang of the North and the historic Paoay Church, built between 1699 and 1707.</p>
            <p>The town's name is derived from "makapaway kami," meaning "We can live alone," a testament to the settlers' resilience against external threats.</p>
