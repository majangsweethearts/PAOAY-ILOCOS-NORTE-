            <h2>Paoay Lake</h2>
            <p>Paoay Lake (locally known as Dacquel a Danum; Ilokano: Big Water) is a lake within the municipality of Paoay, in northwestern Luzon, Philippines.[1] It is the largest lake in the province of Ilocos Norte and one of the largest natural lakes in the area.

                Historically known as Lago de Nanguyudan,[2] the lake supposedly was the site of a prosperous barangay called San Juan de Sahagún (Saint John of Sahagún) that sank after an earthquake.[3] The freshwater lake and its 1-kilometre (0.62 mi) surroundings was declared a national park in 1969 by virtue of Republic Act 5631.[4] In 1978, through Presidential Decree 1554, the park was reduced to an area of 340 hectares (3.4 km2) concentrated on the lake itself around its highest water level.[5]
