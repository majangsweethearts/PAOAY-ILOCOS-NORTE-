            <h2>Malacañang of the North</h2>
            <p>The Malacañang of the North, also known as “Malacañang ti Amianan” in the Ilocano dialect, is a national park and museum located in Brgy. Suba in Paoay, Ilocos Norte. This majestic mansion was built in 1977 by the Philippine Tourism Authority and was originally the official residence of the late President Ferdinand Marcos and his family when visiting his home province.

                This 5-hectare property was a gift to former President Marcos Sr. on his 60th birthday by his wife, the First Lady Imelda Marcos. The Malacañang of the North features intricate designs with a mix of Spanish, Filipino, and Ilocano architecture. The mansion is a two-story building with large rooms, grand staircases, and beautifully crafted wooden furniture. The balconies and windows offer stunning views of Paoay Lake, enhancing its charm and historical feel.</p>
