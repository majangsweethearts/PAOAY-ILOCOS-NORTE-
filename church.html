            <h2>Paoay Church</h2>
            <p>The Saint Augustine Parish Church (Spanish: Iglesia de San Agust√≠n de Paoay), commonly known as the Paoay Church, is a Roman Catholic church in the municipality of Paoay, Ilocos Norte in the Philippines. It is under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Laoag. Completed in 1710, the church is famous for its distinct architecture highlighted by the enormous buttresses on the sides and back of the building. It is declared as a National Cultural Treasure by the Philippine government in 1973 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the collective group of Baroque Churches of the Philippines in 1993.</p>
