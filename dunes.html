            <h2>Paoay Sand Dunes</h2>
            <p>The Paoay Sand Dunes are a popular geological site and tourist spot along the eastern coast of Ilocos Norte. The whole area spans about 88 square kilometers and is best known as a great spot for 4x4 jeep rides across the sand and sandboarding. During a 4x4 ride here, you will race across the dunes and feel your adrenaline rush as you make your way through bumpy trails. You will also pass by a bamboo art installation that is dedicated to one of the most famous Filipino actresses, Nora Aunor, for her performance in the 1982 movie called "Himala". For sandboarding, you will ride a board down smooth sandy slopes that lead to the area's beach. </p>
